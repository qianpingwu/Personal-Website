Qianping Wu (Alice) is an international student from China. I am an undergraduate student at UCLA and expect to graduate in June 2025. I have been studying in the United States for 6 years. My major is Statistics & Data Science, and I look forward to a job (Statistics, Business Analysis, Data Analysis, Data Science, etc) to gain more professional knowledge and work experience and also want to use what I learned in class in real life.
